Getting the understanding of building an MCP using TS and nodes from this
documentation that leverage to get started: https://serveravatar.com/create-mcp-server-nodejs/ 


Currently having an issue with the name of the mcp coming as "0". Looking reco from the LLM
it says to:
Full path: C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\globalStorage\github.copilot-chat\mcp.json

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-mcp-server-1": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["[Location where file is]/server.js"]
    }
  }
}

2025-12-28. 
I also added the dotenv for env and variables. 
I also added the test. Currently only for calculate. 

I did not add the Security part yet:
- sanitation (DONE)
- authentication and authorization. (NOT STARTED)
