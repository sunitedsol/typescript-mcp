Getting the understanding of building an MCP using TS and nodes from this
documentation: https://serveravatar.com/create-mcp-server-nodejs/
github for it: https://github.com/srvrsoorg/my-mcp-server 


Currently having an issue with the name of the mcp coming as "0". Looking reco from the LLM
it says to:
Full path: C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\globalStorage\github.copilot-chat\mcp.json

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-mcp-server-1": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["[Location where file is]/server.js"]
    }
  }
}

I also added the dotenv for env and variables.
